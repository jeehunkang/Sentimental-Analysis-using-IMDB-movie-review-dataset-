# Sentimental-Analysis-using-IMDB-movie-review-dataset-

This research was conducted by Jee Hun Kang and Tianyao Pu from Fordham University. 

Abstract: 

Sentiment analysis has become a popular and
common task in Natural Language Processing. There are various
classification models available to perform the sentiment analysis.
We are interested in investigating whether complex models
generally perform better than traditional models on the identical
text mining task. By performing the sentiment analysis task with
different classification models with varying model complexities on
an identical dataset, we can explain the cause of the potential
differences in model performance based on the research results.
The results should not only include the prediction accuracy of each
model, but also other factors that are involved throughout the
process, for example, the computational efficiency. The entire
process includes but is not limited to data analysis, data
preprocessing, model training and tuning, and result comparison.
